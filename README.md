# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis we are downloading an amazon  data set of reviews of automotive parts. We are comparing this data in order to find out if paying the small fee to get the vine members to review the product, does guarantee a better review rating. In order to do this comparison we are filtering the parts that have 20 or more reviews and that the helpful votes is 50% or greater than the total votes. Also, we are filtering to obtain the 5 stars reviews  and compare the percentage of these based if they were reviewed by the vine members. 
## Results
  * In the data set we obtained 82 Vine reviews and 24742 non-Vine reviews.
  * In the data set we obtained 33 5-stars Vine reviews and 12807 5-stars non-Vine reviews.
  * The percentage of 5-stars Vine reviews was 40.2% and the percentage of 5-stars non-Vine reviews was 51.8%

## Summary
All in all we found that the non-Vine 5-stars reviews percentage was a little bit higher than the 5-stars Vine reviews percentage; which implies that there is not a bias that favors those paying fee reviews to get the vine members to rate the products. Also, the slight percentage of 5-stars reviews that have the non-Vine reviews could be explained by the hypothesis that reviews done by people that actually needed the product would be expected to be better.
Another analysis that we could do to check if the Vine reviews are positively biased is to check the 1 star reviews in the Vine and non-Vine groups in order to see if the Vine reviews are more favorable than the non-Vine reviews.
